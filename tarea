Git (/ɡɪt/)[7] is a distributed version-control
system for tracking changes in source code during software development.[8] It is designed for coordinating work among programmers,
but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
Its goals include speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and support for
distributed, non-linear workflows.[11]

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the
Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial
development.[12] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.
As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most
client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a
full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking
abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13]
